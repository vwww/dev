  There are five movie theaters in Farville: the
  Strand, the Bijou, the Palace, the Capital, and
  the Odeon. Last week each one featured a different
  film starring the five favorite femme-fatales
  of Frankie (the film fanatic) Fusco. The
  five films starred Julie Christie, Bette Davis,
  Glenda Jackson, Marilyn Monroe (a revival
  film), and Katherine Hepburn. Each night during
  the week, Frankie went to see a different
  film. From the clues given try to determine the
  star, the theater, the type of film (drama,
  comedy, western, thriller, or mystery), and the
  night on which Frankie saw each film.
