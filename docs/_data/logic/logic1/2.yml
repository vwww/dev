  Some women from the District Attorney's office
  went out to dinner last night. Elizabeth,
  Gladys, Barbara, Virginia and Gwendolyn were
  their names, and each ordered a different main
  course. Steak, ham, chicken, pork, and lamb
  were the only main courses on the menu. Each
  woman also ordered mashed potatoes, salad,
  and a different vegetable. The five vegetables
  on the menu were peas, carrots, corn, squash,
  and spinach. What main course and vegetable
  did each woman have?
