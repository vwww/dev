name: Park Street Residents
desc: >
  The Wilcoxes, the Byrds, the Talmadges, the
  Marsdens, and the Levers all live on the west
  side of Park Street. The numbers on the houses
  run from south to north, with the highest number
  being the most northerly, and only odd
  numbers are used on the west side of the street.
  Each house has white trim, but the main color
  of each house is different. The colors are red,
  brown, tan, yellow, and green. On the front
  lawn of each house there is a different type of
  tree in the central position. The five trees are
  an oak, an elm, an ash, a willow, and a maple.

  family the color of the house, the type of tree
  they have planted out front, and the address
  number of the house.
