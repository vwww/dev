  The miles-per-gallon ratings on a single model of a
  car may vary for many reasons, including the test
  driver and other factors. A new model line of
  popular car called the Zinx, during tests, produced
  mpg's of 32, 31, 30, 29, and 28. Each car was a
  different one of these five colors: blue, green, red,
  white, and yellow. Each car was driven by a
  different one of these five drivers: Cox, Durham,
