name: Forks in the Road
desc: >
  There are five forks in the road from Tratsburg to
  Denville. Turning left at each of these five forks will
  lead to one of these five towns: Asterly, Hornton,
  Seattle, Teasdale, and Thornberry. Turning right at
  each of the five forks will lead to one of these five
  towns: Estwater, Houston, Stewartville, Tewsbury,
  and Thousand Oaks. From the information given,
  determine the left and right turning at each fork in
  the road, as well as the order that a traveler would
  come upon the five forks heading from Tratsburg to
  Denville.
clues:
- >
  The fork in the road to Houston comes earlier
  than the one to Tewsbury but later than the ones
  to Teasdale or Thornberry, but neither of these
  two is a turning at the first fork in the road.
- >
  There is not a fork with roads to Stewartville
  and Asterly.
- >
  The fork with a road to Thousand Oaks comes before the one to Teasdale, but
  after the one to Stewartville.

  The fork to Hornton is not at the same place as the one to Stewartville or
  Tewsbury.
