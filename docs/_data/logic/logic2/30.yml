  The six top finishers in a Rubik's cube contest
  solved the cube in 0:29, 0:35, 0:51, 1:10, 1:26, and
  1:30. Each started by completing a top color. Each
  one chose a different color to start with: blue, green,
  orange, red, white, and yellow. Of the six, three
  were boys named Eric, Oswald, and Wilbur, and
  three were girls named Gretchen, Lily, and Wendy.
  From the information given, determine how long it
  took for each one to solve the cube and what color
  each one used as a top starting color.
clues:
- >
  Gretchen's time was faster than Lily's time but
  slower than Eric's time; these three kids, like the
  girl who won the contest, did not begin with
  orange or green on top.
- >
  The girl who started with red finished later than
  the kid who started with orange but earlier than
  the girl who started with blue.
- >
  The kid who started with yellow on top finished earlier than Wilbur but not first.
- >
  Lily finished the cube earlier than Oswald.
