  shelves. On each shelf he keeps three different types
  of prizes. On the left-hand sides of the shelves he
  keeps ashtrays, electronic games, toy trains,
  watches, and water pistols. On the right-hand sides
  of the shelves he keeps blenders, stereos, stuffed
  animals, TVs, and whistles. On the centers of the
  shelves he keeps candy, clocks, dolls, toy boats, and
