name: Returning from Vacation
desc: >
  Five couples who live on Maple Avenue in
  Forestville were all away on vacation for the same
  two weeks during the summer. The Smiths had kept
  the keys to the houses of all five couples in order to
  water the plants. The couples are named Finn,
  Gersten, Hawkins, O'Malley, and Webster. They
  were each on vacation in a different one of these
  five cities: Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Reno,
  and Vancouver. Each couple returned by a different
  means of transportation, either airplane, camper, bus,
  car, or train. From the information given, determine
  the order in which they returned, where they had
  been, and how they got home.
