  Ms. Smith plans her week's work and pleasure
  precisely. She schedules a different activity each
  weekday for the morning, afternoon, and evening, in
  addition to her daily chores of making beds, doing
  dishes, etc. In the mornings she keeps one free,
  works at a hospital, does her ironing, does her
  laundry, and helps out at the preschool that her
  youngest child attends. The activities occupying her
  afternoons are cleaning the bathrooms, gardening,
  cleaning the kitchen, cleaning the upstairs, and
  vacuuming. The five activities that occupy her evenings
  are bowling, bridge, night class at the local
  college, gym workout, and going to the movies.
  From the information given, determine what she does
  in the morning, afternoon, and evening of each day
  Monday through Friday.
clues:
- >
  The morning that she has free, except for daily chores, is on an earlier day of the week than
  the afternoon when she does the gardening but later than the afternoon when she does
  the vacuuming, which is not Monday.
- >
  Her gym workout is not on Friday but it is later in the week than the night when
  she goes bowling, which in turn is later in the week than the night when she plays bridge,
  but none of these evening activities is on the same day when she has a free morning.
- >
  She does the laundry and cleans the bathroom on the same day.
- >
  On the day she has an afternoon to work in the garden, she has already been to her night
  class but she has yet to put in her morning of volunteer work at the hospital.
- >
  She works at the preschool later in the week than the day when she cleans
  the kitchen floor.
