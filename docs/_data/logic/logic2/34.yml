  Five friends enjoy raising tropical fish. They
  each have a different one of these size tanks: 50
  gallons, 30 gallons, 25 gallons, 20 gallons, and JO
  gallons. There are three boys named Arthur,
  Martin, and Maurice as well as two girls named
  Alice and Maureen. They each raise a different one
  of these types of fish: angelfish, cichlids, gouramis,
  guppies, and neon tetras. From the information
  given, determine the size of each person's tank and
  the type of fish raised.
clues:
- >
  Neither Martin nor Alice raise neon tetras and
  the same is true of the girl with the largest tank
  of all and the boy with the smallest tank of all.
- >
  Maurice does not raise gouramis.
- >
  Arthur's tank is larger than the tank in which
  angelfish are raised which is not the smallest tank.
- >
  Martin has a smaller tank than the kid who raises cichlids but a larger one than
  the tank in which neon tetras are raised.
