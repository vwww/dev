I hacked my Windows Experience Index rating! My rating is way better than yours, if you don't believe it, view the screenshot! For my <mark>real ratings, subtract 10</mark> from each individual score. Yes, my <mark>real score is 5.9, but I deserve 6.82 as an average or even 6.84</mark>29525791137848568296393718408... as the root mean square! See how I did it in the full article.

It was a simple hack. Simply <mark>browse to `C:\Windows\Performance\WinSAT\DataStore`</mark> and find the <mark>most recent `\[date\] Formal.Assessment (Recent).WinSAT.xml`</mark>. <mark>Edit</mark> the scores and <mark>profit</mark>. If you can't read it, use an XML formatter.
