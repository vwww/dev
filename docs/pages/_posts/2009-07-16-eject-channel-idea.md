I'm going to <mark>create a new channel for my Wii</mark>. It will allow you to use all four Wii remotes, and maybe the GameCube controllers!

<!--more-->

It will be a <mark>*.dol* I make with **devKitPro** on my Windows XP PC</mark> and then compiled into a *.wad* channel. **devKitPro** uses C/C++, and since I am used to coding in VB, it might be hard, but I used PHP for my websites, and <mark>PHP is similar to C and C++</mark>. The <mark>channel icon and banner will be my own Photoshop image</mark>, created from (almost) scratch.

You have to use any of the 4 controllers to select if you want it to <mark>Eject the disc, reboot, power off to red, power off to yellow, or return</mark> to the Main System menu.

If I include <mark>GameCube controller</mark> support, it'll probably be <mark>L to eject, R to not eject, A to return to the main menu, B to power off to red, X to reboot, and Y to power off to yellow. And press Z to do the actions.</mark>
