<mark>There is a bug for the trial</mark> version: when you start it up, <mark>because of my special encoding (to prevent reverse engineering), you need to click `Continue`</mark>; however, if you click `Quit`, you need to start the program again. Just click continue!

Download at: (not available anymore)

If it doesn't run, because you don't have the .NET Framework, <mark>either [download the framework](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22), or download one without framework</mark>.
