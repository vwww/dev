I have created a web-site that shows all of my <mark>cloud renderings of the samples</mark>. It is available at [victorz.ca/misc/3d/](https://victorz.ca/misc/3d/).

At first, 1 render = 1 cloud unit, when the service was called *Autodesk Cloud* with its subordinate <mark>*Autodesk Cloud Rendering*</mark>.

Later, they renamed it to *Autodesk 360* and its complement <mark>*Autodesk 360 Rendering*</mark>, and made <mark>1 render = 5 cloud units</mark>. They also upped the limit to 75 cloud units, and made me have <mark>50 used up (10/15 renders)</mark>, which is nowhere near the 160 renders.

Still, I noticed a flaw: the <mark>cloud units are not subtracted until after the rendering is complete</mark>, which causes the following effect, -10 cloud units (-2 renders) remain when I sent 3 renders on the last credit.

<div class="img-center">
<img src="{{assets}}victorz/blog_images/2012/auto-lulz.png" width="400" alt="Autodesk Failure!" />
</div>

To reproduce this, just <mark>send multiple renders when you're on your last credit</mark>.
