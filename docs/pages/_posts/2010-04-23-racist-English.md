> ANGELS ARE WHITE: DEVILS ARE BLACK

You know what I think? <mark>That statement is false</mark>. I've thought about the word "whitelist" and "blacklist" from webmasters' IP control vocabulary. The <mark>English language is very racist</mark>.

> Whitelist: List of allowed IPs (nobody is allowed except these when used alone), which sometimes takes precedence over the blacklist

> Blacklist: List of disallowed IPs (everyone is allowed except these)

> Black-hat: Someone that hacks to cause trouble; a virus or malware creator.

> White-hat: Someone that hacks to prevent Black-hats from doing; A black-hat that reports and fixes instead of infecting.

Some more examples that I thought are good from [thepatrioticvanguard.com/racism-in-the-english-language](https://thepatrioticvanguard.com/racism-in-the-english-language):

> Black Art/Magic: magic involving the supposed invocation of evil spirits for evil purposes.

> Black Flag: ( Historical ): a flag hoisted outside a prison to announce an execution

> Blackmail: an action of demanding money from a person in return for not revealing discreditable information or the use of threat or unfair manipulation in an attempt to influence someone's actions.

> Black Market: an illegal trade in officially controlled or scarce goods

> Blackout: a sudden failure of electricity or loss of consciousness

> Black Money: income obtained illegally or not declared for tax purposes

Now, some more from that site with the opposite effect:

> White Collar: relating to work done or people who work in an office or other professional environment \[NOTE: heavy labor jobs are actually **blue** collar, not black\]

> White Hope: a person expected to bring much success to a team or organization

> White Knight: a person or thing that comes to somebody's aid

> White Information: positive information about a person

> White Lie: a harmless lie

> White Magic: magic used only for good purposes

> White Flag: symbolises a desire for peace or dialogue, ceasing hostilities
