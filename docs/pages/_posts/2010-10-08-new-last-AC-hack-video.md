I have made a new---and likely my last---AssaultCube video at [youtu.be/RLfnl9fU7h4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLfnl9fU7h4) and [youtu.be/W1ej0-yjas8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1ej0-yjas8).

This is the <mark>very likely to be my last AssaultCube video</mark>. This video <mark>shows the changes</mark> I have made in my Vulcan Mod revision 3. I have made some changes such as <mark>crash fixes</mark>, which is solved in rev3b.

If they try to claim copyright, I will do the same and counter-claim. <mark>They can only claim copyright on this video</mark> since the other ones won the dispute. <mark>If they take this video down, it will go back up in two weeks and never down again</mark>! They might be smart enough to realize that it is pointless for them to do that unless they want two weeks <mark>without the **new** video only</mark>, they are wasting their and my time if they do it.

**EDIT:** *<mark>AssaultCube sucks</mark>; I do not play it anymore and do not care about nor plan on blogging about it anymore.*
