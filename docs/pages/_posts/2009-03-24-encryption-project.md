I started <mark>a program, coded in VB .NET, that will let you encrypt</mark> stuff (text and files) It comes with a bonus pack, with <mark>MD5 hashing, SHA, a Luhn algorithm checker, and more</mark>. It <mark>should be finished in a few days</mark>. I'm <mark>working on the AES</mark> file and text encryption.
