I have <mark>decided to remove cIOSCORP</mark>, as it is not necessary anymore: I can <mark>still launch backups through backup launchers</mark> (NeoGamma, ~~Gecko OS~~, USB loaders, etc.)

**TL;DR** <mark>Since I have System Menu 3.4U, these operations are planned</mark> to reverse the effects of cIOSCORP:

These IOSes are present in all of those cIOSCORP packages: (Click Read More...)

<!--more-->

* IOS9 - update
* IOS11 - update into stub, danger for System Menu 2.0
* IOS12-15 - update
* IOS17 - update
* IOS20 - update into stub, danger for System Menu 2.2
* IOS21,22 - update
* IOS28 - update
* IOS30 - update into stub, danger for System Menu 3.0 - 3.3
* IOS31 - update
* IOS33 - 38 - update
* IOS40,41,43,45,46 - Korean IOSes, so delete?
* <span style="background-color: #ff9900;">IOS50 - install v4889 (!!!) because v5120 is a stub, danger for System Menu 3.4</span>
* IOS52 - I somehow have this, and it's for 3.5 for Korean Wiis, so update into stub
* IOS53 - update
* IOS55 - update
* IOS56 - update
* IOS60 - update into stub, danger for System Menu 4.0 - 4.1
* IOS70 - update into stub, danger for System Menu 4.2

In order to do this, I remembered that I have installed <mark>cIOSCORP 3.3 to 3.5 in a forgotten order</mark>, which means <mark>a union of all of them are installed</mark>. <mark>3.3 will be ignored, since all of it is overwritten by 3.4</mark>. For the lists below, "Patch" means "ES\_DiVerify/ES\_Identify Patch", both of which are the same. 3.4 IOSes are listed before 3.5 ones. All the highlighted ones are "scrambled".

* <span style="background-color: #99cc00;">IOS9</span> = IOS53 v5149 with rev14/13 DIP
* <span style="background-color: #99cc00;">IOS11</span> = IOS53 v5149 with rev14 DIP / IOS60 v6174 with rev13 DIP + Patch
* <span style="background-color: #99cc00;">IOS12-15</span> = IOS53 v5149 with rev14 DIP
* <span style="background-color: #99cc00;">IOS17</span> = IOS53 v5149 with rev14 DIP
* <span style="background-color: #99cc00;">IOS20</span> = IOS53 v5149 with rev14 DIP / IOS60 v6174 with rev13 DIP + Patch
* <span style="background-color: #99cc00;">IOS21-22</span> = IOS53 v5149 with rev14 DIP
* IOS28 = IOS28 v1293 with rev14 DIP
* <span style="background-color: #99cc00;">IOS30</span> = (IOS53 v5149 with rev12 DIP / IOS60 v6174 with rev13 DIP) + Patch
* IOS31 = IOS31 v3092 with rev14 DIP
* IOS33 = IOS33 v2834 with rev14 DIP
* IOS34 = IOS34 v3091 with rev14 DIP
* IOS35 = IOS35 v3092 with rev14 DIP + Patch
* IOS36 = IOS36 v3094 with rev12/13 DIP + Patch + NAND Permissions Patch
* IOS37 = IOS37 v3612 with rev14 DIP / IOS37 v3612 with rev14 DIP + ES\_Identify Patch + NAND Permissions Patch
* IOS38 = IOS38 v3610 with rev14 DIP
* IOS50 = IOS50 v4889 with rev12/13 DIP + Patch
* IOS53 = IOS53 v5149 with rev14 DIP
* IOS55 = IOS55 v5149 with rev14 DIP
* IOS56 = IOS56 v5146 with rev14 DIP
* IOS60 = IOS60 v6174 with rev12/13 DIP + Patch

With cIOS 3.5, these IOSes were present:

* <span style="background-color: #99cc00;">IOS40</span> = IOS60 v6174 with rev13 DIP + Patch
* IOS41 = IOS41 v3091 with rev14 DIP
* IOS43 = IOS43 v3091 with rev14 DIP
* IOS45 = IOS45 v3091 with rev14 DIP
* IOS46 = IOS46 v3093 with rev14 DIP
* IOS52 = IOS52 v5661 with rev13 DIP + Patch
* <span style="background-color: #99cc00;">IOS70</span> = IOS60 v6174 with rev13 DIP + Patch

I have also <mark>found some other IOSes</mark>:

* IOS2 0x181 (v385)
* IOS16 0x101 (v257) - will be mothballed if I update in the future...

In the future, <mark>I shall perform those actions, except for IOS50, and hope that my Wii will not brick</mark>.
