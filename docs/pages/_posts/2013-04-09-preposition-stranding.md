Why can't prepositions be used as something to end sentences _with_?

Prepositions are fine <mark>to end sentences _with_</mark>. Prohibitions against preposition stranding are nothing anyone should listen _to_. (actually an infinitive marker) It is a <mark>made-up rule</mark> that does not reflect the true state of the language, so it is nothing anyone should worry _about_. Worrying about it is also something they (because English lacks a singular genderless personal pronoun) should not suffer _from_.

[Look it _up_](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004454.html)! (actually an adverb)

However, the [misattribution to Churchill](https://brians.wsu.edu/2016/11/14/churchill-on-prepositions/) is something with which we should not put _up_. Even though he did not say it, it is still something no person should put up _with_.

<mark>Some sentences cannot be reworded to avoid stranding the preposition</mark> no matter how hard you try _to_.

> **The chair** was sat **on**. (passive)

> **What** is this tool **for**? (copula)

> This is **what** he came back to me **with**. (fused relative pronoun)

> This is **something** to look **at**. (infinitive phrase)

The first one simply has nothing it can be replaced _with_. The object of the preposition is the subject, omitted for the second time.

The second one cannot be reworded as *\*For what is this tool?* because it must be *For what purpose does this tool serve?* As another example, *This is what the tool is for* becomes expanded to *This is that which the tool is for*. It cannot be *\*This is that for which the tool is*, so it is due to the copula rather than the fused relative pronoun.

The third one is ungrammatical as *\*This is with what he came back to me* unless it is a question such as *With what did he come back to me?*

The last one is awkward when corrected with *<sup>?</sup>This is something at which to look*. because *at which to look* might mean *that to look at*.

The practice of preposition stranding is something that even the [University of Oxford's English Department](https://oxforddictionaries.com/words/ending-sentences-with-prepositions) approves _of_.

However, when doing <mark>**formal writing**, it is usually better to _front_ the prepositions</mark> instead of using them as something _with which sentences are ended_. Other than that, <mark>feel free to end sentences with prepositions</mark> without worrying about grammar complaints whenever you want _to_.
