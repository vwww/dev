I have <mark>extended my domain for a year by transferring it</mark>. It won't expire until April, but <mark>it's unwise to attempt a transfer during the last few days, in case something goes wrong</mark>. However, I had to <mark>pay extra</mark> fees...

$12.88 (base price) - $3.00 (promotion) = <mark>**$9.88 CAD** initially</mark>

$9.88 * (100% + 12% HST) + $0.22 <mark>Paypal fee</mark> = $11.29 (<mark>rounded up</mark> from $11.2856)

Since it was in CAD, and I received payments in USD, PayPal also charged extra for <mark>currency conversion</mark>, since 1 USD = 1.01 CAD at that time...

$11.29 CAD / 0.981321 = <mark>**$11.51 USD** finally</mark> (<mark>rounded up again</mark>!!!)

After all that, I ended up paying <mark>16% more (rounded down)</mark>. All of <mark>this rounding was not in my favor</mark>.
