I used some cheats on the Wind Waker with my Wii, but only to be reflected with this glitch. <mark>When I have to unlock the Earth Temple, I already have the Earth God's Lyric</mark>. As a result, <mark>going to Headstone Island and trying to "learn" the song fails</mark>. Using another cheat to "forget" the song, I go "learn" it again the way I am supposed to. Then I have to go find <mark>Medli, but she somehow disappeared</mark> from the location she should be at.

UPDATE: <mark>I have found a fix</mark> for my problem!

I tried a cheat to "downgrade" the Master Sword. The first one only affected the visual effect, but then I tried again and changed one value, which was taken from the <mark>*Fully Charged Master Sword*</mark> cheat (if only they had warned me about this), from F (15, 0b1111) to 3 (0b0011) because the <mark>least significant bit (LSB) is the sword</mark>, the next one is the <mark>master sword</mark>, then the <mark>half charged sword</mark>, then the <mark>full master sword</mark>. I believe that the weapon bits' being full put Medli in the incomplete dungeon instead of Dragon Roost Island. *I wonder if I could use this to get <mark>extra firepower</mark> with the standard or partial master sword (9, 0b1001, or 11, 0b1011)...*
