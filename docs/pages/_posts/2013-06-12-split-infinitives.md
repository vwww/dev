Some people are <mark>hypercritical and think *to boldly go* should be *to go boldly* or even the awkward *boldly to go*</mark>. However, the argument is that English should follow Latin's rules, but it is <mark>impossible to split infinitives in Latin, as there is no infinitive marker in Latin</mark>, effectively making the argument invalid.

Also, <mark>wouldn't the effect of some sentences be destroyed</mark>? There is no way to reword these without forming an awkward sentence:

> I need you all <mark>**to really pull**</mark> your weight.

> We are determined <mark>**to completely and utterly eradicate**</mark> the disease.

> I expect him <mark>**to completely and utterly fail**</mark>.

> We are seeking a plan <mark>**to gradually, systematically, and economically relieve**</mark> the burden.

> We expect our output <mark>**to more than double**</mark> in a year.

> I want <mark>**to not see**</mark> you anymore. (Well, maybe "I <mark>do not want to</mark> see you anymore")

> Source: ["Split infinitive" from *Wikipedia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_infinitive)

<mark>Remember **to, whenever you want, split** infinitives</mark>. To, regardless of what some prescriptivists say, split an infinitive is perfectly valid.
