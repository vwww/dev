I went to the <mark>Salmon Run on Saturday in the morning</mark>. Adams River was full of bright red salmon. Most of the <mark>salmon were smart enough to swim along the side of the river</mark> because <mark>the center is the most turbulent</mark>, making <mark>the sides require the least energy to move</mark>.

I wonder,

> <mark>Why</mark> would the salmon want to <mark>swim out of the ocean into the rivers</mark>?

I stayed at a hotel in Salmon Arm that night after watching the salmon, which was the <mark>only time I had internet access for the two days</mark>. I got back at <mark>10 PM yesterday</mark>.
