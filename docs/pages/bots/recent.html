  This bot is down.
  It has been discontinued, so it will not be restored for a long time.

  Also, it suffered the same fate as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(bot)">Microsoft's Tay bot</a>.
  Twitter has permanently suspended the account and stated that &ldquo;this decision will not be reversed.&rdquo;

    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/recentideas">@recentideas</a> uses machine learning to learn how to tweet from recent tweets.</p>
    <p>
      A model (second-order Markov chain) predicts the next word from the previous two.
      Twitter's tweets train the model using Hebbian learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      To give more weight to recent tweets, periodically, weights are cut in half.
      When that happens, edges (transitions) whose weight fall below a threshold are removed.
      Then nodes (states) without incoming transitions are removed.
      This also conserves memory.
    </p>
    <p>Periodically, the bot generates and posts a tweet containing</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the total number of states and transitions (in base-36)</li>
      <li>the sentence generated by following transitions of the highest weight</li>
      <li>randomly-generated sentences using weights in the model (repeated until the length limit of 280 characters)</li>
    </ul>
