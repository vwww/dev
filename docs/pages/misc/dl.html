    While this is now a custom-built solution,
    the downloads section of my website originally used
    Evoluted's <a href="https://www.evoluted.net/blog/development/php-directory-listing-script" rel="nofollow">PHP Directory Listing Script</a> v3, and
    later on, it became a modified version of that script.
