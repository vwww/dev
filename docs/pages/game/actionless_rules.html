<h1>Gameplay</h1>
<p>Each round, players cannot choose to take any action that affects the outcome.</p>
<p>When the timer expires, the round ends, and one randomly-selected player wins.</p>

<h1>Time Control</h1>
<p>Intermissions last up to 5 seconds, ending early if all players are ready.</p>
<p>Each round is 3 seconds long.</p>

<h1>Options</h1>

<h2>Independent <small>(default: off)</small></h2>
<p>Each player or team has a 50% chance of winning, independently of others.</p>

<h2>Teams <small>(default: 0)</small></h2>
<p>Players randomly fill teams. If nonzero, this is the number of teams. Otherwise, there is one team per player.</p>
<p>Team sizes are approximately equal. The size of the largest team is at most one plus the size of the smallest team.</p>
