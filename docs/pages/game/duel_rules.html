<h1>Gameplay</h1>

<p>This game is 20% luck and 80% skill (by default).</p>

<p>
  It is similar to agar.io: players are circles (or spheres) and can eat other players.
  However, here, luck sometimes allows smaller players to eat bigger players.
  The winrate of humans against bots is also increased.
</p>

<p>This game is still under development.</p>
