<h1>Gameplay</h1>
<p>Cheat is a shedding card game, but players can be dishonest. The minimum player count is 2, but there must be at least 3 players to remove perfect information about card counts.</p>
<p>Each turn, the current player discards some cards and claims that they are cards of the same rank. Players win when they have discarded all of their cards. The turn order is random.</p>
<p>
  Other players have a chance to call "cheat" and challenge the cards that were just played, causing the entire discard pile to go to a player as a penalty.
  If the move was honest (the cards match the claim), penalty cards go to the player who made the claim. Otherwise, penalty cards go to the dishonest player.
  The winner starts the first trick of the next round.
  To allow for a chance to call "cheat", the system will allow time before the next move can be finalized.
  To prevent misclicks, calling cheat is not possible in the first 750 ms after a move has finished or player has left.
</p>

<p>If a player leaves, all his cards go into the bottom of the discard pile, but he gets the worst possible rank, and the turn timer and 750ms minimum call timer (but not maximum call timer) is reset. If he made the last move, it can no longer be challenged.</p>

<h2>Ranks</h2>
<p>The cards ranks (4 each per deck) are in this order from lowest to highest:</p>
<pre>Ace &lt; 2 &lt; 3 &lt; 4 &lt; 5 &lt; 6 &lt; 7 &lt; 8 &lt; 9 &lt; 10 &lt; Jack &lt; Queen &lt; King</pre>

<p>Jokers (2/deck) are wildcards and may be used as any card.</p>

<h1>Time Control</h1>
<p>Intermissions last up to 30 seconds, ending early if all players are ready.</p>
<p>
  Each turn lasts up to 20 seconds by default, with automatic skip/pass/random move (in that order).
  Unused turn time cannot be carried to future turns.
  There is only a turn timer, not a game timer.
</p>

<h1>Options</h1>

<h2>Turn Time / s <small>(default: 20, min: 5, max: 60)</small></h2>
<p>A random move will be made after the turn timer expires.</p>

<h2>Call Time / s <small>(default: 5, min: 2, max: 10)</small></h2>
<p>Turns use this time as the minimum time whenever there is a previous move, allowing players to call cheat. This cannot exceed the Turn Time.</p>

<h2>Decks <small>(default: 1, min: 1, max: 2<sup>51</sup>)</small></h2>
<p>Number of decks to use.</p>

<h2>Check</h2>
<p>How are challenges resolved?</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>arbiter</strong>: no information revealed
  <li><strong>caller</strong>: the player who called the challenge checks the cards privately
  <li><strong>public</strong> <em>(default)</em>: the challenged cards are revealed to all publicly
  <li><strong>public+</strong>: the cards below the challenged cards are shuffled, and all cards are revealed publicly
</ul>

<h2>Count (off/on, default: all on)</h2>
<p>How many cards may be played after the first turn? Any count may be played on the first turn.</p>
<p>If the current player has fewer cards than required, all of them may or must be played.</p>
<p>If only decreasing is enabled, after playing a single card, the trick ends.</p>
<p>At least one option must be enabled, or else the server will enable all of them.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>same</strong>: same count as the previous move
  <li><strong>more</strong>: more cards than the previous move
  <li><strong>less</strong>: fewer cards than the previous
</ul>

<h2>Trick Rank (off/on, default: first 5 on)</h2>
<p>What card ranks may be played after the first turn? Any rank may be played on the first turn of a trick.</p>
<p>If no card claim is possible, the current player starts a new trick.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>same</strong>: same rank as previous move</li>
  <li><strong>up 1</strong>: previous plus one, when not wrapping</li>
  <li><strong>up 1 wrap</strong>: previous plus one, when wrapping</li>
  <li><strong>down 1</strong>: previous minus one, when not wrapping</li>
  <li><strong>down 1 wrap</strong></li>
  <li><strong>up 2</strong>: previous plus two, when not wrapping</li>
  <li><strong>up 2 wrap</strong></li>
  <li><strong>down 2</strong></li>
  <li><strong>down 2 wrap</strong></li>
  <li><strong>others</strong>: other ranks not covered above</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tricks</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>skip</strong> <em>(default)</em>: play or skip your turn
  <li><strong>pass</strong>: play or pass; passing prevents playing until next trick
  <li><strong>forced</strong>: must play every turn
</ul>
