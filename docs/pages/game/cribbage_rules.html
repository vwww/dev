<h1>Gameplay</h1>
<p>Cribbage is a matching card game. The minimum player count is 2, and the maximum player count is 4.</p>
<p>Players are shuffled and move in a random order.</p>

<p>If a player leaves, he gets the worst unfilled rank, and the round ends without giving a result to other players.</p>

<h2>Rounds</h2>

<p>Each round (hand) consists of these phases:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Deal</b>:
    <ul>
      <li>A random player is selected to be the dealer (equivalent to having players cut for the lowest card to be dealer).
      <li>Each player is dealt 6 cards (2 players) or 5 cards (3 or 4 players).
      <li>If there are 3 players, a face-down card is dealt into the crib. Otherwise, the crib is empty.
      <li>Each player keeps 4 cards, discarding the other 1 or 2 face-down into the crib.
      <li>After players have moved, a face-up card is revealed. If the card is a Jack, the dealer gets 2 points.
    </ul>
  <li><b>Play</b>:
    <ul>
      <li>The player after the dealer moves first.
      <li>Players play one card if the count (cumulative value of cards played) does not exceed 31 and must do so if possible, or automatically pass (call "Go").
      <li>If the count is 15, the player scores 2 points.
      <li>Completing a pair scores 2 points. Completing 3 of a kind counts as 3 pairs for 6 points. Completing 4 of a kind counts as 6 pairs for 12 points.
      <li>A run of 3 or more cards (consecutively played but in any order, with consecutive values when sorted) scores the number of cards in the run.
      <li>The next player moves until everyone has passed.
      <li>The last player to move scores 1 point if the count is less than 31 or 2 points if the count is 31.
      <li>The count is reset to 0, and the next player (after the last player to move) moves first. If all cards have been played, the game goes to the Show.
    </ul>
  <li><b>Show</b>: Starting with the player after the dealer, each player scores points by combining his hand (played cards) with the starter card and considering each subset of those cards:
    <ul>
      <li>Total of 15 (2 points)
      <li>Runs of at least 3 cards (1 point per card)
      <li>Pairs (2 points)
      <li>Four-card flush (same suit) (4 points)
      <li>Five-card flush (5 points)
      <li>Jack of same suit as the starter card (1 point)
    </ul>
    After the dealer moves, the crib is also scored as his hard, but four-card flushes count as 0 points.
</ol>

<h2>Card Ranks</h2>
<p>The cards (4 each per deck) are in this order from lowest to highest:</p>
<pre>Ace &lt; 2 &lt; 3 &lt; 4 &lt; 5 &lt; 6 &lt; 7 &lt; 8 &lt; 9 &lt; 10 &lt; Jack &lt; Queen &lt; King</pre>
<p>Ace has a value of 1. Jack, Queen, and King have a value of 10.</p>

<h1>Time Control</h1>
<p>Intermissions last up to 30 seconds, ending early if all players are ready.</p>
<p>
  Each turn lasts up to 20 seconds by default, with automatic moves.
  Unused turn time cannot be carried to future turns.
  There is only a turn timer, not a game timer.
</p>

<h1>Options</h1>

<h2>Turn Time / s <small>(default: 20, min: 5, max: 60)</small></h2>
<p>An arbitrary move will be made after the turn timer expires.</p>

<h2>Score Target <small>(default: 121, min: 1, max: 1000)</small></h2>
<p>The game immediately ends when a player has at least this score. 61 and 121 are commonly used values.</p>
