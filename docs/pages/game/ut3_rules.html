<h1>Gameplay</h1>
<p>Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a more advanced version of the two-player board game Tic-Tac-Toe.</p>

<p>
  Winning on a small board is the same as in regular Tic-Tac-Toe.
  The first player to win a small board wins it.
  Each small board has either zero or one winner.
  If a small board is won or full (equivalently, won or drawn), it is closed, and no further moves may be made in it.
</p>

<p>
  The first player may start in any small board.
  Making a move "sends" the opponent to the corresponding small board.
  If that board is closed, the next move can be made in any other open board.
</p>

<p>
  To win the match, a player must win on the big board by winning three small boards in a line, as if the small boards were the cells in regular Tic-Tac-Toe.
  If all small boards are closed, and the big board is not won, the match ends in a draw.
</p>

<h1>Time Control</h1>
<p>Intermissions last up to 30 seconds, ending early if all players are ready.</p>
<p>Each turn lasts up to 15 seconds by default, with automatic random moves. Unused turn time cannot be carried to future turns. There is only a turn timer, not a game timer.</p>

<h1>Options</h1>

<h2>Turn Time / s <small>(default: 15, min: 5, max: 60)</small></h2>
<p>A random move will be made after the turn timer expires.</p>

<h2>Inverted <small>(switch winning and losing, default: off)</small></h2>
<p>Winners and losers are swapped. Draws and resign/forfeit are unaffected.</p>

<h2>Checked <small>(default: off)</small></h2>
<p>
  This disallows obviously bad moves.
  If the opponent can win in one move (zero moves in Inverted), you are in check. Moves that make you in check (or lose in Inverted) are invalid.
  If you have no valid moves, and the game is not drawn, you lose by checkmate.
</p>

<h2>Quick <small>(default: off)</small></h2>
<p>Capture one small board to win (enabling Checked is recommended, to avoid misclicks).</p>

<h2>Open <small>(default: off)</small></h2>
<p>Moves are allowed on any open small board, in any unoccupied cell.</p>
