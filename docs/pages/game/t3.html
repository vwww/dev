<h2>Player Types</h2>
<p><strong>Human</strong> players are controlled in the user interface.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong> bot always chooses the lowest-numbered positions, so you can easily beat it.</p>
<p><strong>Random</strong> bot chooses whatever it &ldquo;feels like&rdquo;, even if it is a bad choice. If you don&rsquo;t like its choice, you can undo your move and redo it.</p>
<p><strong>Nice</strong> bot tries to lose as soon as possible, tie, and then win as late as possible. If it chooses all of its moves under default rules, it never wins.</p>
<p><strong>Optimal</strong> bot tries to win as soon as possible, tie, and then lose as late as possible. If it chooses all of its moves under default rules, it never loses.</p>
