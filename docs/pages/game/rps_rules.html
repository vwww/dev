<h1>Gameplay</h1>
<p>New players start with 0 (battle, round) (wins, losses, ties), score, and streak.</p>

<h2>Round</h2>

<p>In a round, these phases occur:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Intermission
  <li>Move selection
  <li>Damage calculation
  <li>Battle execution
  <li>Score calculation
</ol>

<h3>Intermission</h3>
<p>A 5-second intermission between rounds allows new players to join and current players to review the previous round's results.</p>

<h3>Move selection</h3>
<p>Every player has four options: pick <u>Rock</u>, <u>Paper</u>, <u>Scissors</u>, or <u>Auto</u>. If Auto is selected, the game replaces the player's choice: one of the first three is randomly selected, or if the player has a streak bonus, an optimal choice is made automatically.</p>

<h3>Damage calculation</h3>
<p>When two moves are the same, the result is always a tie.</p>

<p>This phase calculates the results of the other possible move pairs. By default,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rock beats Scissors
  <li>Scissors beats Paper
  <li>Paper beats Rock
</ul>

<p>If <b>Inverted</b> is on, the defaults are reversed. If <b>Count</b> is on, when a pair of moves is chosen by a different number of players, the one with more players never loses (see below for more details).</p>

<h3>Battle execution</h3>
<p>Unless modified by <b>Team</b> or <b>Survivor</b>, all N(N-1)/2 pairs of N participating players battle each other. After that, players have wins, losses, and ties within the round.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger">
  For the mathematically inclined, imagine a complete undirected graph, whose nodes are players and edges are battles.
</div>

<h3>Score calculation</h3>
<p>Players win, lose, or tie the round by comparing wins and losses in that round's battles. The table shows the effect on their streak and score.</p>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-hover">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Wins vs Losses</th>
      <th>Outcome</th>
      <th>Effect on Streak</th>
      <th>Effect on Score</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>Equal</td>
    <td>the round is a tie</td>
    <td>none</td>
    <td>none</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>More wins</td>
    <td>the player wins the round</td>
    <td>streak becomes 0 if previously negative, and is then incremented</td>
    <td>gain 1 score point, adjusted by streak bonuses</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>More losses</td>
    <td>the player loses the round</td>
    <td>streak becomes 0 if previously positive, and is then decremented</td>
    <td>lose 1 score point</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Streak Bonuses</h2>
<p>Unless <b>Classic</b> is on, these reward lucky players that win repeatedly, and they also help unlucky players recover from their losses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>+3 or higher: score multiplier = (streak - 1)
  <li>-5 or lower: if no choice is made, an optimal choice is automatically made (not available if Team is active)
</ul>

<h1>Time Control</h1>
<p>Intermissions last up to 5 seconds, ending early if all players are ready.</p>
<p>Each round lasts a variable amount of time (3-30 seconds, default 5).</p>

<h1>Options</h1>

<h2>Round Time / ms <small>(default: 5000, min: 3000, max: 30000)</small></h2>
<p>A random move will be made after the round timer expires.</p>

<h2>Bot Balance <small>(default: 0, min: -1000, max: 1000)</small></h2>
<p>If negative, balance total players to absolute value; otherwise, add this number of bots.</p>

<h2>Classic <small>(ancient, no streak bonuses, default: off)</small></h2>
<p>Streak bonuses are not used, but streaks are still calculated as usual.</p>

<h2>Inverted <small>(reverse default damage direction, default: off)</small></h2>
<p>The default damage direction is reversed. By this new default, rock beats paper, which beats scissors, which beats rock.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rock beats Paper
  <li>Paper beats Scissors
  <li>Scissors beats Rock
</ul>

<h2>Count <small>(larger number never loses, default: off)</small></h2>
<p>If more people choose a type of move than another one, the loss is negated. If at least twice as many people choose a normally losing move compared to a normally winning move, the damage direction is reversed. Consider these examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>3 players pick rock, and 3 players picks paper: rock loses to paper, as usual.
  <li>4 players pick rock, and 3 players picks paper: rock ties with paper.
  <li>5 players pick rock, and 3 players picks paper: rock ties with paper, again.
  <li>6 players pick rock, and 3 players picks paper: rock beats paper.
</ul>
<p>The effects of Count apply after the effects of Inverted.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
  Players that collude might be able to ruin this gamemode.
</div>

<h2><s>Team</s> <small>(default: 0, future feature)</small></h2>
<p>No pair of players on the same team battle each other; battles apply only to pairs of players on different teams.
<div class="alert alert-danger">
  For k teams, a graph representation is a complete k-partite graph.
</div>

<h2><s>Cancel</s> <small>(reduce common amounts, default: off, future feature)</small></h2>
<p>Score calculation is done as if 3 players who chose rock, paper, scissors are removed until no move has more than 1 player remaining.</p>

<h2><s>Survivor</s> <small>(elimination rounds, default: off, future feature)</small></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Players that just joined recently start with zero health points.
  <li>Players that just lost a round lose one health point.
  <li>Players that have zero health points cannot participate.
  <li>When only one survivor (or zero) remains, all player health points are reset to a positive number.
</ul>
