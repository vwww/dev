<h1>Gameplay</h1>

<div class="alert alert-info">
  This game is isomorphic to the board game <strong>Love Letter</strong> for 3 or 4 players (or in <mark>Extended</mark>, <strong>Love Letter Premium Edition</strong> for 5 to 8 players), except it is perpetual, replacing Tokens of Affection.
</div>

<p>
  Players take turns until the draw pile has one or zero cards remaining.
  Each player always has 2 cards when taking a turn, 1 card when otherwise in game, and 0 when eliminated.
  The minimum player count is 2, but there must be at least 3 players to remove perfect information about card counts.
</p>

<p>
  Each turn, a player draws a card and uses one, which activates its effect.
  The turn order is random, but the first player is a randomly selected previous winner (<code>last rank</code> is 1 on the scoreboard), when possible.
</p>

<p>When a card is used or destroyed, it is discarded face up, and then the card's effect activates.</p>

<p>
  Eliminated players destroy all cards in their hands.
  <mark>If 6b is in the eliminated player's discard pile and not the last card, the eliminated player partially wins.</mark>
  Leaving players are treated as eliminated and reset the turn timer.
</p>

<p>
  The game ends when the draw pile has 0 cards (or 1 card before drawing), or when only 1 player remains.
  The player who has the highest adjusted hand value (the hand card value <mark>+ hand bonus</mark>) wins.
  If a player has two cards in hand when the game ends, the recently-drawn card must be returned to the draw pile, without contributing to the hand value.
  If there is a tie, the tie breaker is the sum of discarded card values. If there is still a tie, those players are equally ranked.
  Eliminated players are ranked by the order of elimination, below players who were not eliminated.
</p>

<p><mark>After determining ranks, if a <span class="badge text-bg-warning">WATCHED</span> player has rank 1, the player who discarded 0b, if still present, partially wins.</mark></p>

<p>When a player partially wins, his win counter is increased by 1 without affecting any other score or streak.</p>

<h2>Cards</h2>

<p>There are 16 <mark>(32 in Extended)</mark> cards per deck:</p>

<p>Only 8 has an effect when it is destroyed (same as effect when used). If any other card is destroyed, the player draws another card to replace it.</p>

<p>
  If players are to be targeted, but no target valid (by <span class="badge text-bg-info">IMMUNE</span> <mark>or <span class="badge text-bg-danger">REQUIRED</span></mark>), the targeting fails, and no effect occurs, since the effect requires a valid target and is skipped.
  Some cards do not target: 4, 7, <mark>6b, 5b, 0c</mark>.
</p>

<p>A target is valid if it meets the textual constraint ("another" excludes the targeter, "different" requires the members to be distinct), <mark>contains all <span class="badge text-bg-danger">REQUIRED</span> players,</mark> and does not contain any <span class="badge text-bg-info">IMMUNE</span> members.</p>

<p>
  In some cases, the constraints are impossible to satisfy.
  If targeting other players, and all other players are <span class="badge text-bg-info">IMMUNE</span>, <mark>or a player is both <span class="badge text-bg-danger">REQUIRED</span> and either the targeter or <span class="badge text-bg-info">IMMUNE</span>,</mark> no target is valid.
  <mark>If the <span class="badge text-bg-danger">REQUIRED</span> player is not targeting and is not <span class="badge text-bg-info">IMMUNE</span>, that player can be targeted twice (3b), or the targeter can target himself and the <span class="badge text-bg-danger">REQUIRED</span> player (2b).</mark>
  A player who activates 5 <mark>or 4b</mark> can always target someone (himself <mark>or the <span class="badge text-bg-danger">REQUIRED</span> player</mark>) <mark>unless someone is both <span class="badge text-bg-danger">REQUIRED</span> and <span class="badge text-bg-info">IMMUNE</span></mark>.

<h3>Adjustments</h3>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
  The hand bonus is the number of 5b in the cardholder's discard pile + 4 if any of these conditions are met (otherwise + 0):
  <ul>
    <li>8 is in hand and 9b is in another player's hand.</li>
    <li>7 or 7b is in hand, both 5b are in discard pile, another player has 8 in hand, and another player has 9b in hand and has lower discard sum than cardholder</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The hand bonus rules might seem complex, but they are required to satisfy</p>

        <li>12 = Princess</li>

<h2>Honesty</h2>
<p>
  In real life, players can cheat by lying when targeted by 1 <mark>or 9b</mark> or by not using 7 when required.
  Preventing such cheating, the game server makes it better than the physical version,
  which needs an arbitrator, who would likely rather play.
</p>

<h1>Time Control</h1>
<p>Intermissions last up to 30 seconds, ending early if all players are ready.</p>
<p>Each turn lasts up to 20 seconds by default, with automatic random moves by default. Unused turn time cannot be carried to future turns. There is only a turn timer, not a game timer.</p>

<h1>Options</h1>

<h2>Turn Time / s <small>(default: 20, min: 5, max: 60)</small></h2>
<p>A random move will be made after the turn timer expires.</p>

<h2>Decks <small>(default: 1, min: 1, max: 3)</small></h2>
<p>Number of decks in play. This setting does not increase the threshold of 2 cards, which ends the game when there are less than 2 cards in the draw pile.</p>

<h1>FUTURE Options</h1>

<h2>Extended <small>(default: off)</small></h2>
<p>Enable extra cards and <mark>highlighted portions</mark>.</p>
<p>The rules are currently based on Love Letter Premium Edition, but another mode might be added to be based on Love Letter Second Edition.</p>
