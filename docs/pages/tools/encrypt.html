<p>I planned to make a tool to encrypt/decrypt/encode/decode text/bytes, but <a href="https://cryptii.com">Cryptii beat me to it</a>.</p>

<p>A long time ago, I also made an encryption tool, now available for <a href="https://github.com/theonlypwner/encryption/releases">download</a> from the <a href="https://github.com/theonlypwner/encryption">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
