    Many games and sports play multiple rounds, also known as first-to-n or best-of-(2n-1).
    This structure amplifies skill gaps, as the underdog is more likely to lose the match than an individual round, <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/458808">following a negative binomial distribution</a>.

<p>
    In the table above, the cell shows the expected value for the current player.
    The row is the number of points for the opponent.
    The column is the number of points for the current player.
</p>

<p>
    If a multiple-round lead is required,
    use a draw value of 0 for the probability that the current player wins the match, and
    use 1 for the probability that the current player wins or draws.
