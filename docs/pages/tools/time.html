  This page shows time perception according to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.2466%2Fpms.1975.41.1.235">model proposed by Lemlich (1975)</a>.
  Under this model, the amount of subjective time that passes per amount of real time is inversely proportional to total elapsed subjective time.
  Equivalently, the amount of real time that passes per amount of subjective time is proportional to total elapsed subjective time.
  When the differential equation is solved, subjective time is proportional to the square root of real time.

<p>
  In the top chart, the blue line shows real time on the x-axis and subjective time on the y-axis.
  The shape of this chart corresponds to the name of the time scale.
</p>

<p>
  In the bottom chart, each rectangle represents one year.
  The x-axis is rescaled to subjective time.
  The white line shows subjective time on the x-axis and real time on the y-axis.
