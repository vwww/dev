<p>At up to 1032&times; your Internet connection speed (CPU and Disk are likely bottlenecks), these magical files can be downloaded quickly (even if they might have the wrong magic number in their header signatures).</p>

<p>These files have infinite sizes, so they take infinite time to download.</p>
