    My grammar bot (who)
    <ul>
      <li>corrects Twitter users&rsquo; grammar (what, where)</li>
      <li>since 2012 (when)</li>
      <li>to serve the public interest by educating users (why),</li>
      <li>by <mark>using heuristics to find patterns that usually constitute a solecism and correcting them</mark> (how).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It <mark>doesn't just correct everything</mark>; there are some restrictions.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Notify-Once Restriction</strong> - the bot will <mark>try not to correct you if you have been</mark> corrected <mark>in the last month</mark>.</p>
    <p><strong>Follower Restrictions</strong> - the bot <mark>automatically adjusts the follower count threshold</mark> (slightly) every 15 tweets or 16 hours, whichever occurs earlier, to maintain approximately 1 tweet/3 hours for each of the 14 checks. Some of the checks do not occur often enough, so this results in <mark>less than 120 tweets/day</mark>. Probably only 75% (90 tweets/day) will occur. Also, the <mark>minimum follower:following ratio is 3:2 (1.5)</mark>.</p>

        You need to meet the follower requirement, which dynamically changes, within a few (about 4) minutes of the tweet. <mark>After 8 minutes, it is safe to assume that you will not be corrected.</mark> If you wish to be corrected, you may <mark>force a correction by saying &ldquo;#GRAMMAROVERRIDE&rdquo; or &ldquo;I donâ€™t supposed to make this mistake.&rdquo;</mark> Any tweet containing that statement (with the period, without quotation marks) or the hashtag (it must be entirely in capitals) is exempt from the follower restriction, but it is also case-sensitive.

        <mark>No, this is a style choice</mark> in American English, whose historical &lsquo;rule&rsquo; was created to place &lsquo;convenience above logic&rsquo;: the newspaper printing presses might go out of alignment if the period is outside of the quotation marks, but the British still risked misalignment.

        The bot <mark>corrects for the grammar error, not for the misspelling</mark>. For example, <code>there is</code> is sometimes mistyped as <code>*their is</code> and will be corrected. However, <code>sneak *peak</code> (a sneaky mountain?) is sometimes misused to mean <code>sneak peek</code> (preview of the future). Both are valid noun phrases, so this does not concern grammar.

        <del>The account name is <mark>intended to mean ((Your Grammar) Police) rather than (Your (Grammar Police))</mark> and therefore means <mark><code>Police of Your Grammar</code> rather than <code>Grammar Police of You</code></mark>, so despite the awkward construction, there is no error.

Usually, &lsquo;fewer&rsquo; is preferred over &lsquo;less&rsquo; for countable nouns (except amounts like time, money, distance, speed, etc.) but does not have to be used, just like in the quote from Alfred the Great: "Swa mid l&aelig;s worda swa mid ma, sw&aelig;&eth;er we hit &#541;ereccan ma&#541;on."

          Upon registration, I agreed to the Twitter Terms of Service, Rules, and Privacy Policy.<br>
          My actions do not violate any rules specified those pages. The only prohibited uses of @replies are these two:
        </p>

        <p>
          to send large numbers of duplicate @replies or mentions;<br>
          to send large numbers of unsolicited @replies or mentions in an<br>
          attempt to spam a service or link
        </p>

        <p>
          My account, by sending @replies in a manner similar to that of @StealthMountain, does not spam any service nor does it spam links. Since it only @replies a user that it has not @replied before, it does not send any duplicates @replies.<br>
          There is no prohibited following behavior that was/is/will be engaged in.
        </p>

        <p>
          You may review all of this account's tweets, and you will find that all of them do not even mention any service, and all of them have no links. They are all @replies, with no links and no services.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thank you in advance!

        Their automated system requires me to make a reply before they will consider my request:
        <blockquote class="blockquote text-right">
          I confirm that the account complies with the Twitter Rules as described in my initial request.
