My website first started out as a static Microsoft Frontpage website in late 2004. Around 2005-2006, I adapted it into PHP, rewrote a basic script, and then modified a free template.

By early 2008, most of this site became PHP generator scripts, but small portions were static HTML. By 2010, most subpages used various different templates.

In late 2013, it was rewritten in Jekyll. The homepage used the Twitter on Github template, but subpages still had different themes.

_Recently_, in 2015, it was recreated with Bootstrap. Old and new features are also being (re)implemented. In 2019, scripts are also being ported to TypeScript.

_History is not retained!_

In the past, files would be stored on some web server without any version control. Also, directory listings were private.

Unlike code for other projects, history is not as important for this website.
